I recently spoke with my brother. He has a very different attitude about food than I do. For me, food should taste good and be really good for my body. I want to live a long, healthy, productive life, and I know that that dream will be realized in large part by what I choose to put into my body. 

When I was a little girl, I watched my grandma die of diabetes. It was very traumatic for me. She first had to have part of her foot amputated and then her leg below her knee. In talking to my dad, it sounds like they didn’t eat very healthy in their home. My grandpa wouldn’t eat vegetables at all so it wasn’t something they even had in the home. When my parents got married, my mother had quite the task ahead of her to convince my dad that he could be different than his parents without betraying them.

So, I wish I could say to my brother: “Yes, you only live once, so why not make it the very best? Food doesn’t have to be gross just because it is healthy!”
