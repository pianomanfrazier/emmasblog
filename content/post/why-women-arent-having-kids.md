**bold text goes here** and *some italics*

Recently I read [this article](https://nyti.ms/2KSrN1P) in the New York Times. I agree with some of what the author says. She has a long list of reasons why Americans aren't having babies. The lists references reasons that range everything from monetary to selfish to anxiety to age to thoughts about themselves. I do agree that these things may affect families having babies, but I argue that there is another problem that isn't even mentioned in the article.

This reason has to do with actually getting the baby into the the world.

This reason is called the Hospital.

Or, in a larger sense, this reason is the birthing culture in our country.

When I was pregnant with my first baby, I was amazed at how many women, often complete strangers, would approach to tell in graphic detail about their birthing horror stories. Somehow my distended stomach gave them permission to reveal to me their darkest hours. These stories were worse than any Stephen King novel or Alfred Hitchcock movie because, like it or not, I was going to have to  baby had to come out and, of course, there was no way I could leave to have the baby. When I got pregnant with number 2, the number dropped dramatically, maybe because women thought that I already knew how horrible birthing was. No one tells me their stories now. Maybe I have made myself unapproachable and I won't let them. Maybe I should be more sympathetic. But I'm not. 

Or was there. There is a magical word. It is called "epidural." Men can say that word really well. 

Men are weenies and won't support their women in the hospitals. Many of the men my husband talks to are scared of women's anatomy words. Words like vaginal and cervix and uterus. I'm not sure how to deal with this because they obviously aren't scared enough of their women to avoid making the baby. They just aren't willing to put themselves out there to help their women get the baby out.

Women ingest all of the garbage they are fed about birthing and they just hand their bodies over to the "authorities" to save them from themselves. Pregnancy and birthing are illnesses, the hospitals provide the cure. Then, when they are baby raped in the hospital, it confirms what they believe about themselves. Their bodies are broken. Irreparable. They won't do their research and own their births and their bodies.

Then when women who have otherwise good, providing, happy husbands tell me about how the hospital exploited them, I wonder, "Where was your husband?" When a woman is birthing she needs someone there to advocate for her. She needs a husband who is willing to throw around a couple of punches to protect his woman and his baby. I'll tell you about macho. Macho is the man who will defend his woman in her most vulnerable and yet her most empowering state. This state has potential for the most glory and for the most shame.

I know plenty of women who would have more children if their experiences in the hospitals were more positive. It is so sad to me. I used to get angry. Now I just blame the woman for putting herself in that situation. For not doing her research and making an informed choice based on real statistics. For not trusting her body. 

It's all lies. Birthing is empowering. It is ennobling. It is a rite of passage. I believe women told me their stories because they felt that they had been robbed of one of the greatest things that they could do as a woman. Maybe they didn't want that to happen to me. Maybe they 

The other thing that bugs me about this article is its claims about gender equality. Is gender equality's goal to turn women into men and men into genderless blobs, then I guess they are right. Recently our life insurance provider told us that my home "earnings" were around $60,000. 

If your goal is to create a family, then men and women have to be different. Just because I do not make the same number of dollars in a month doesn't mean that my contribution to society and to our home is any less significant. Both are needed to make this family work. 

What is the definition of a good parent? Does it mean that I have to "control" my children in every situation? I have learned that parenting often has to do with me relinquishing my illusion of control. My identity is not defined by what my children do or do not do. My job it to teach them. Finally they have to control themselves. 

- list 1
- list item 2
- and
- so forth

1. numbered
2. lists
3. are like this

a. a list
b. item 2
c. howdy
	i. roman
	ii. numerals
	iii. are great

It's a strange world we live in. It's shameful to have children. And even stranger to want lots of children.
