Review of “Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons”

I have used this book to teach three of my children to read. Each child is different and I have had to use slightly different strategies for each child. There are some commonalities in the things that they struggle with that I believe are indigent to the curriculum of the book itself.

Usually I have a child go through half of a lesson per day. When the child starts at age 3 or 3 ½, this is about all they can handle. Although it doesn’t seem like much, a little bit five days a week for two years goes a really long way. I really try to be sensitive to when they max out and then let them go play. Even if they only learn one or two things in a session, I count the lesson as successful, knowing that I can build on that next time. Both of my older girls have been reading really well by the time they reached Kindergarten. This has given them a big advantage at school.

What I like about this book:

The pacing of the book is brilliant. I love how it teaches how to sound out words, how to rhyming words relate, and how only one sound is introduced at a time over many lessons. It has lots of review of both sounds and words.

The book teaches the sound of the letters instead of the letter names. Letter names can be taught later. I also like how it teaches common words like “said” and “I” and sound blends like “th”, “ch”, “ing”, and “ar”. 

Once a foundation of sounds is established a story is included in every lesson. The stories, especially in the first half of the book, are short, silly, and age appropriate. 

The term “sight word” is never mentioned in this book. I am anti-sight word when it replaces teaching letter sounds reinforced through books. I know, sight words are often the words break the rules, but there are rules that are never broken. For example, “P” never ever makes an “L” sound and “E” never makes a “K” sound.  The sound variations can be taught and the children can learn to figure out what sound to say or if the letter is silent. 

The book teaches writing from the very first lesson. Although I have not done this from the beginning with all of my children, I do have them writing before they get to Kindergarten. I like that this important aspect of reading is taught in this book. I teach them to write when they are developmentally ready.

(Not about the book specifically but about teaching children to read in general)
Learning to read has really helped my children’s diction. I was a bit hesitant to teach my son to read because he struggled with pronunciation but he was so insistent that I taught him earlier than I would have had it been all up to me. I am so glad I did because he is much easier to understand now and I believe that this has a lot to do with teaching him to read. 

I am an educator at heart. I find it incredibly rewarding to watch a child learn how to read. I also love having that time every day to bond with my child. Teaching my children to read are among some of my sweetest memories from when they were preschool aged. 

What I don’t like:

Vowels:
The book differentiates between long vowels and short vowels. Traditionally, we learn that “A” can be short or long, but “A” also makes a short “u” sound. This occurs most commonly in the word “a” as in “a big red ball” but it also occurs commonly at the ends of names like Emma, Matilda, Hannah, and Rebecca.  

There is no differentiation between the “I” sound of “Y” and the “E” sound of “Y”. 

The book does not teach rules for when the vowels are long or short. Even though they are broken (as in the word “have”) they should still be taught.

Consonants:

Consonants and consonant blends also have different sounds. For example:

“Th” has two different sounds. For example, the “th” in “with” is different than the “th” in “this.” 

The letter “C” also has two very distinct sounds. This is not addressed in this book.

The book waits until very late in the curriculum to introduce “b”. I think they do that to avoid confusion with “d” but they are going to have to grapple with that sooner or later and there are a lot of words that use “b” that are avoided because the sound is not in their vocabulary.

Pictures:

The book seems to have an aversion to pictures. Every story has one and only one picture. This is fine when there are only one or two sentences; however, once the stories become several paragraphs in length, the lack of pictures in relation to the amount of words is overwhelming for the child. When I move my children to picture books, they use the pictures as context clues to figure out the words. The book suggests that I never show the picture until after they have read the story. I have never done this and I haven’t had any problems. In fact, it is more engaging for them when they can find the picture of the word they are reading as they go along. The words also become memorable when they are taught simultaneously with pictures.

Upper and lower case letters:

The book only teaches lower case letters until very late in the book. I don’t have a solution that would fit within the context of “100 Easy Lesson” without completely restructuring the second half of the book, but the leap is a bit sudden and daunting for a child.

Writing:

The book suggest that the child only write individual letters. If they are reading words they should be writing words. I like to either draw the picture for them to color or  have them draw a picture and then write the word several times either in the word or under it.

Conclusion:
This being said, the book is a great point of departure and I will continue to use it to teach the rest of my children to read. I do not use this as the only source for teaching my child to read, but it is my primer. I have my children read the “Bob” books and then we check out books from the library once our own library has been exhuasted. I teach them the vowel rules as we go. I also let my older girls use apps on the tablet to teach them their upper case letters and then reinforce that in the books. 

When they are old enough to write, I have the write words on paper that I have either printed out from a free download online or from a writing book purchased at the local grocery store.
